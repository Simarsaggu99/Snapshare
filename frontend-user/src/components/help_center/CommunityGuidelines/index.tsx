          Snapshare is dedicated to providing a fun and safe way to search,
          create, and share the best snaps, GiFs and other infographics on the
          internet. Snapshare posts, once indexed, can be seen by anybody using
          Snapshare; therefore, it’s important to be mindful of the type of posts
          that are appropriate for the site. To do that, we’ve set up a few
          guidelines that we ask you to follow. Thanks for helping us make
          Snapshare a positive experience for everyone!
