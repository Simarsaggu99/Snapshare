        The idea of Snapshare was initiated in order to spread laughter and jokes
        in the form of memes and gifs. We also planned to reward our users as
        they are responsible for enrichment of quality in their content. We aim
        to build the biggest directory of good quality memes and gifs on the
        internet. Founded in 2020, during the first wave of pandemic, so that
        even the students and any unemployed people could get an interesting
        platform where they could easily earn some money and help their
        families. This platform is not meant to publish any serious content so
        it&lsquo;s advisable to not be offended by any content you find here.
        However, we take our community guidelines seriously and do not allow any
        inappropriate content that is not acceptable by the laws. We regularly
        monitor the content as much as possible and expect our users to report
        inappropriate content as well. We literally made this platform to share
        jokes and no content found here has anything to do with reality. So
        enjoy your time here and earn coins to redeem them in cash.
